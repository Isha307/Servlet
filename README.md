## Execution of Servlets involves six basic steps:

* The clients send the request to the web server.

* The web server receives the request.

* The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.

* The servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of output.

* The servlet sends the response back to the web server.

* The web server sends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.
