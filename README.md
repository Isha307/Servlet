## SERVLET

Java Program that runs within a Web Server.


## Execution of Servlets involves six basic steps:

[1]The clients send the request to the web server.
[2]The web server receives the request.
[3]The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.
[4]The servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of output.
[5]The servlet sends the response back to the web server.
[6]The web server sends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.
